## First Project on Markdown!

![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)

There are few things I have learnt by attending AJ's project on Saturday which is called:

 __BEYOND CODE BOOTCAMP__

See the list below with the things we both went through on our first lesson.

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com)

> By clicking on GitHub, Stack Overflow or Meetup it will re-direct you to their Home webpage.

_I have made a table below of sources I used to complete my first project_.
